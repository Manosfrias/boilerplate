# Boilerplate
This is a homemade boilerplate for static websites, using __Sass + Javascript__ and compiling with webpack

## Inspiration
I read this [insteresting article](https://hackernoon.com/a-tale-of-webpack-4-and-how-to-finally-configure-it-in-the-right-way-4e94c8e7e5c1) from Margarita Obraztsova ([@marharyta](https://github.com/marharyta)) about how to configure Webpack the right way, looking for how to set up webpack with sass.

I just follow her lead, nothing new or original. But, is here for my new projects.
